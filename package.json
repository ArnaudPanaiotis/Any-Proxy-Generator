Now you can try them out before you buy with MTG Proxy-Generator! Create proxy versions of cards or even decks to playtest before purchasing. Just enter a list in MTGO format with one card name per line. You can then print them out 9 on a page and insert them over other cards in sleeves to playtest. ## Import Decks Using Easy MTGO Syntax ![edit screen](Screenshots/3.png) ## Create Proxy-Versions of Decks You'd Like to Test ![review screen](Screenshots/1.png) ## Choose Whatever Print Your Heart Desires! ![review screen](Screenshots/2.png) ## Technology Used: This app was built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Bootstrap.
